# Contributing

## CLA

New contributors will need to sign a [contributor license agreement](https://cla.vmware.com) before code changes can be merged. Follow the instructions given by `vmwclabot` after opening a pull request.

## CHANGELOG 

Authors are expected to include a changelog file with their pull requests. The changelog file
should be a new file created in the `changelogs/unreleased` folder. The file should follow the
naming convention of `pr-username` and the contents of the file should be your text for the
changelog.
