    <summary>A highly extensible platform for developers to better understand the complexity of Kubernetes clusters.
</summary>
<description><![CDATA[Octant is a tool for developers to understand how applications run on a Kubernetes cluster. It aims to be part of the developer's toolkit for gaining insight and approaching complexity found in Kubernetes. Octant offers a combination of introspective tooling, cluster navigation, and object management along with a plugin system to further extend its capabilities.

## Features

#### Resource Viewer

Graphically visualizate relationships between objects in a Kubernetes cluster. The status of individual objects are represented by color to show workload performance.

#### Summary View

Consolidated status and configuration information in a single page aggregated from output typically found using multiple kubectl commands.

#### Port Forward

Forward a local port to a running pod with a single button for debugging applications and even port forward multiple pods across namespaces.
 
#### Log Stream

View log streams of pod and container activity for troubleshooting or monitoring without holding multiple terminals open.

#### Label Filter

Organize workloads with label filtering for inspecting clusters with a high volume of objects in a namespace.

#### Cluster Navigation

Easily change between namespaces or contexts across different clusters. Multiple kubeconfig files are also supported.

#### Plugin System

Highly extensible plugin system for users to provide additional functionality through gRPC. Plugin authors can add components on top of existing views.]]></description>
