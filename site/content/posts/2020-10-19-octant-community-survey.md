# Octant User Survey
## The Octant user survey is here! 
Hello folks! The Octant team has been hard at work on the latest release, listening to your feedback through issues, and improving the product as a whole. We’ve appreciated the issues and PR’s you’ve filed, and we’re looking to expand how we capture feedback and learn from our users. 

Stepping back, we’ve felt the need not only to learn about how we can improve Octant, but to learn more about our users as a whole. We want to understand the why, the how, and the who of Octant through our user’s perspectives. This will help to inform the Octant roadmap, prioritize features, and create a knowledge base of common workflows.

## How You Can Participate
We’ve launched the [Octant Community Survey](https://forms.gle/LLmSGkHu91DJNR3P8) for you to share more about yourself, how you use Octant, and to share whatever feedback comes to mind. Your participation in the survey will be tremendously helpful.

We’re looking forward to hearing from you and learning more about how you’re using Octant. For question or comments, please feel free to reach out to us on Slack at [#octant](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CM37M9FCG) or on [Github](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant).

And if you can, please spread the word! A shareable link to the survey can be found here: [https://forms.gle/LLmSGkHu91DJNR3P8](https://forms.gle/LLmSGkHu91DJNR3P8).
