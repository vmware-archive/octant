# Octant 0.10 - New Year, New Features

We have some exciting new features in the [latest release of Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/releases/tag/v0.10.0), such as **Container Exec** and the **Workload Viewer**, together with several quality of life improvements and bug fixes. We are also changing the cadence of our monthly community meeting to weekly, and giving you a quick and easy way to access bleeding edge changes.

## Container Exec

Octant now supports the ability to execute single and interactive commands against containers. This allows you the equivalent of `kubectl exec` directly inside of Octant.

Once an executed process has completed, Octant will hold the output in a terminal window until you dismiss it or stop Octant. This is useful behavior when running one-off, non-interactive commands, and allows you to refer back to the output as needed for debugging and informational purposes.

## Workload Viewer

You can now get an at-a-glance view of the health of all your workloads in a namespace using Octant. A workload card will quickly show you if all of your pods are healthy, and the amount of memory and CPU allocated. Clicking on a workload will take you to the resource viewer for that workload.

This is the early stages of the workload viewer, and as the workload feature continues to progress it will eventually become the default view for Octant.

## More Details

This release also includes bug fixes around CRDs, Plugins, and more. You can find the complete details in our [release notes](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/blob/master/changelogs/CHANGELOG-0.10.md).

## Community Meetings

We will now be holding community meetings weekly on Wednesdays at 1PM ET / 11AM PT. Be sure to join the [project-octant](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/project-octant) Google group to get a calendar invite. We also announce each meeting one hour before start time in the [Octant Slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CM37M9FCG).

## Nightly Builds

As a reminder for those who like to be on the bleeding edge, we have [nightly builds](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/octant-nightlies) available. These are built directly from master each night and allow folks to get faster access to updates and features in-between official releases.
